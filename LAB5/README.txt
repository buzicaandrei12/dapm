During this laboratory I had only one challenge.
When adding items to the listview using the adapter I didn't realize that I have to set the adapter AFTER the addition of elements, so no element showed up at runtime.
After I set the adapter properly, everything was fine, thanks to Sabina who told me to do so.

I have learned in this laboratory how to link ui elements with data with an adapter, and how to do it in an efficient way. The processus is similar to object pulling. 
I think this is the best way to populate a list or a grid or whatever it is you need to populate in an Android app.
